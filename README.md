SQL Analysis:
The SQL section of the project focuses on extracting specific data points and insights. Key queries include:

1.Retrieving all successful bookings.

2.Calculating the average ride distance for each vehicle type.

3.Finding the total number of rides cancelled by customers.

4.Listing the top 5 customers by the number of rides booked.

5.Calculating the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car issues.

6.Finding the maximum and minimum driver ratings for "Prime Sedan" bookings.

7.Retrieving all rides paid for using UPI.

8.Finding the average customer rating per vehicle type.

9.Calculating the total booking value for successful rides.

10.Listing all incomplete rides along with the reason.

Power BI Dashboard:
The Power BI part of the project is designed to create a visual and interactive report. The planned visualizations cover several key areas:


1.Overall Insights: Time-series charts for ride volume and a breakdown of booking statuses.



2.Vehicle Performance: Bar charts for the top 5 vehicle types by ride distance and average customer ratings.



3.Revenue & Customers: Stacked bar charts for revenue by payment method and a leaderboard for the top 5 customers by total booking value.


4.Cancellations: Bar charts highlighting the reasons for ride cancellations by both customers and drivers.



5.Ratings: Visualizations for driver ratings distribution and a scatter plot comparing customer and driver ratings.
